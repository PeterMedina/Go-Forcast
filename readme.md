# Go Forecast

Enter an address or location name and see the current weather for that place.

Uses Google Maps API to convert the location into geographical coordinates that Dark Sky can recognize.

This project was created as an exercise while learning Go, and is based on [Consuming JSON APIs with Go](https://medium.com/@IndianGuru/consuming-json-apis-with-go-d711efc1dcf9) by Satish Manohar Talim.

## Required Packages

Dark Sky and Google Maps require API keys. Store them in an ENV file. This project uses [Go Dot Env](github.com/joho/godotenv) by [John Barton](https://github.com/joho).

## Installation

Download and run the executable.

## Planned Updates

A planned future update of this project will include a table view that shows the forecast for multiple days.
